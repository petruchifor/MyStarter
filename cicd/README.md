# Template Configuration

This folder contains the values and templates as defined in https://github.com/telus/cio-labs/tree/master/cd-pipeline/pipeline-templates
Documentation on how to use is also on that link

This is an alternative to using the values files in ../helm.  The files in ../helm have more parameters than what are defined in values-np.tmpl
Also, there are reference Spinnaker configurations ../spinnaker-ECP-SAMPLE.json and ../spinnaker-release-ECP_SAMPLE.json
